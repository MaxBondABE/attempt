# Timing controls

Timing controls adjust how `attempt` manages time-related aspects of command retries. They determine
the delays between attempts and the time limits for each attempt.

This chapter describes options for wait modification, including jitter and stagger, as well as
timeout configuration. These controls help balance retry responsiveness and resource usage.
